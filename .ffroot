This file allows 'ff -g' to determine root directory for global searches.
Example:
   cd cpp/algo
Find word 'Scheduler' in source files
   ff Scheduler 
Same, but extend search to all relevant directories after searching current
directory:
   ff Scheduler -g

Some other tools check presence of .ffroot to make sure they're run from 
the right location.
